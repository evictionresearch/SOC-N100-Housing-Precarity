    * In your code, put the URL in comments next to the relevant area. 
    * In your writeup, put the URL in footnotes near the section or text in which you used AI. [See AI policy in the Syllabus for more info.](syllabus.html#ai-policy)


These assignments will be graded on the [scale in the syllabus](syllabus.html#course-grading). This grade is to help you see the quality of your work but the final grade will be graded as complete or incomplete. No late assignments will be accepted except for special accommodations. You can volunteer to present a 5-minute demo of your assignment in class.
