    "text": "Course Culture\nStudents taking Stat 20 come from a wide range of backgrounds. We hope to foster an inclusive and supportive learning environment based on curiosity rather than competition. All members of the course community—the instructor, students, tutors, and readers—are expected to treat each other with courtesy and respect.\nYou will be interacting with course staff and fellow students in several different environments: in class, over the discussion forum, and in office hours. Some of these will be in person, some of them will be online, but the same expectations hold: be kind, be respectful, be professional.\nIf you are concerned about classroom environment issues created by other students or course staff, please come talk to us about it.\n\n\nMode of Instruction\nThis course is structured as a flipped class, meaning that you will first be encountering new concepts in statistics and data science outside of class. Class time is dedicated to expanding on the work you’ve done outside of class by working through questions solo, in groups, and as a class.\n\n\nBefore class\nIt is your responsibility to become familiar with the topics that appear in the course notes and to work through the reading questions on Gradescope by 11:59 pm Monday (for Tues/Weds class) and 11:59 pm Wednesday (for Thurs/Fri class). You’re encouraged to experiment to find the method that works best for you: downloading the notes as a pdf and making notes on them, asking and answering questions over the class forum, etc.\n\n\nDuring class on Tue/Wed and Thu/Fri\nClass time (2 hrs) will be spent on a range of activities, but the most common will be concept questions (using Poll Everywhere) and working through components of your Problem Sets and Labs. Therefore, the most efficient way to complete your assignments is to be an active participant in class. Attendance is expected on these class days.\n\n\nDuring class on Monday\nMonday is shorter (1 hr) class that alternates between:\n\nWorkshops: less-structured class dedicated to finishing up work on your assignments\nQuizzes: see information on quizzes below.\n\n\n\n\nGroup tutoring\nTutors will offer group tutoring sessions several times each week. This is an opportunity to finish up any assignments that you’ve started in class or review any topics that are confusing for you. Each group tutoring session will be staffed by 2-4 tutors. You’re welcome to attend any session that works well for your schedule.\nGroup tutoring is a great place to go to meet other students and collaborate on assignments with tutors on hand to help you get unstuck.\n\n\nInstructor Office Hours\nThe instructors will offer office hours each week across a range of times. We ask that you only visit the office hours of your instructor, but you are welcome to visit the tutoring sessions of any tutors, not just the ones who work in your section. We may adjust the office hour and group tutoring sessions schedule throughout the semester as we understand student needs and preferences. Please check the office hours tab on the syllabus page to see the times of the various office hour/group tutoring sessions.\nOffice hours are an opportunity to chat one-on-one with your instructor. Please come to office hours! Coming to office hours does not send a signal that you are behind or need extra help. On the contrary, coming to office hours early and often tends to co-occur with success in the course. Instructors are happy to chat about the course material, statistics in general, careers in statistics, and whatever other statistics or data science topics are on your mind!\n\n\nDon’t come to class if you’re sick!\nMaintaining your health and that of the Berkeley community is of primary importance to course staff, so if you are feeling ill or have been exposed to illness, whether it’s COVID-19 or something else, please do not come to class. All of the materials used in class will be posted to the course website. You’re encouraged to reach out to fellow students to discuss the class materials or stop by group tutoring or office hours to chat with a tutor or the instructor.\n\n\n\nMaterials\nThe primary materials for the course are the lecture notes, which will be posted to the course website in advance of class. We’ll teach you everything you need to know!\n\n\nRStudio\nThe software that we’ll be using for our data analysis is the free and open-source language called R that we’ll be interacting with via software called RStudio. As a Berkeley student, you have your own version of RStudio waiting you for at: http://stat20.datahub.berkeley.edu. Most students taking Stat 20 have no experience programming; we’ll teach you everything you need to know!\n\n\n\nCourse communication\n\nbCourses\nWe will use bCourses to disseminate announcements for the entire class, such as final exam information.\n\n\nDiscussion forum\nThe official discussion forum for the class will be hosted on Ed. Ed is a forum to ask and answer questions with your fellow students and course staff. It’s an indispensable resource for learning from your peers and seeking help from tutors and instructors.\nIf you have a question for staff, create a new post and mark it as “private” and it will go only to course staff. This is the best option to contact us if you have a personal concern. If your question does not include personal information and can be answered by other students, make sure it is public.\nIn a course this large, the instructors have a difficult time responding to individual emails, so please use the class forum or visit office hours if you wish to contact us!\n\n\nCourse website\nAll of the assignments will be posted to the course website at https://stat20.org. This also holds the course notes, the syllabus, and links to Gradescope, Ed, and RStudio.\n\n\n\nAssignments, Exams, and Grading\n\nTurning-in assignments\nYou will be turning in your assignments on a platform called Gradescope. This is also the platform where your assignments will be graded, so you can return there to get feedback on your work. You are welcome to file a regrade request if you notice that we made an error in applying the rubric to your work.\n\n\nLabs\nLabs are long-form assignments designed to apply the concepts from the lecture notes in the cause of doing an analysis of real data. This will involve both writing code and communicating your thoughts and findings in English. We’ll be working through some problems from the labs in class, but you may have to complete them on your own outside of class time. Some labs will be turned in individually; some will be turned in as groups.\nLabs are to be submitted as PDF files. These PDFs will be generated by rendering Quarto Documents (.qmd files) to HTML and then exporting the HTML into a PDF. Don’t worry if you’re not familiar with the Quarto Document as we will teach you about it!\nWe will be assessing most questions on labs for correctness but for others we will be giving credit based on completion.\n\n\nProblem Sets\nDuring class, we will give you a second engagement with the day’s material in the form of a worksheet. These worksheets will run like traditional homework problems and drill the concepts in the reading notes rather than asking you to apply the concepts with a data set, like the lab does.\n\n\n\nReading Questions\nReading questions serve to check your understanding and engagement while going through the lecture notes prior to class. There will be a handful of questions per lecture note. These questions be a mix of multiple choice, short answer, and coding questions. You can answer them directly on Gradescope. The reading questions will be due 11:59 pm on Mondays (for the Tuesday/Wednesday lectures) and Wednesdays (for the Thursday/Friday lectures).\n\n\n\nQuizzes\nQuizzes reinforce the most important concepts from the lecture notes and provide you the opportunity to work through misunderstandings of concepts with peers and the instructor.\nThere is both an individual and group component to the quiz.\nThe individual component will last ~25 minutes. You are allowed one, A4, one-sided handwritten sheet of notes. The group component will take place immediately after the individual component has been completed and will last ~15 minutes. Your final (composite) quiz grade will be the average of your group and individual quiz scores.\n\n\nExam\nThe final exam will be held in person during finals week. The time and date is Thursday, May 9 from 7-10pm (apologies).\n\n\nGrading\nYour final grade in the course will be computed as follows:\n\nLabs 35%\nReading Questions: 3%\nQuizzes 25%\nProblem sets 7%\nFinal 30%\n\nThe grades will not be curved (&gt; 90% is some kind of A, etc.).\nIn order to provide flexibility around emergencies that might arise for you throughout the semester (for example, missing a quiz due to COVID), we will apply for everyone:\n\none emergency drop for quizzes\n\none emergency drop for labs\ntwo emergency drops for problem sets\ntwo emergency drops for reading questions.\n\nThis means, for example, that we will drop your lowest quiz score before computing your average score across all quizzes.\n\n\n\nPolicies\n\nAccomodations for students with disabilities\nStat 20 is a course that is designed to allow all students to succeed. If you have letters of accommodations from the Disabled Students’ Program, please share them with your instructor as soon as possible, and we will work out the necessary arrangements.\n\n\nLate Work\nUnfortunately, with a class of this size, we are unable to keep track of and grade submissions of labs, reading questions, and problem sets that come in very late. If you narrowly miss the standard deadline, you will still be able to submit within an hour for a small penalty (5% reduction in score). If you don’t submit within an hour you can still submit for a larger penalty (30% reduction).\n\n\n\nCollaboration policy\nYou are encouraged to collaborate with your fellow students on problem sets and labs, but the work you turn in should reflect your own understanding and all of your collaborators must be cited. The individual component of quizzes, reading questions, and exams must reflect only your work.\nResearchers don’t use one another’s research without permission; scholars and students always use proper citations in papers; professors may not circulate or publish student papers without the writer’s permission; and students may not circulate or post non-public materials (quizzes, exams, rubrics-any private class materials) from their class without the written permission of the instructor.\nThe general rule: you must not submit assignments that reflect the work of others unless they are a cited collaborator.\nThe following examples of collaboration are allowed and in fact encouraged!\n\nDiscussing how to solve a problem with a classmate.\nShowing your code to a classmate along with an error message or confusing output.\nPosting snippets of your code to the discussion forum when seeking help.\nHelping other students solve questions on the discussion with conceptual pointers or snippets of code that doesn’t whole hog give away the answer.\nGoogling the text of an error message.\nCopying small snippets of code from answers on Stack Overflow.\n\nThe following examples are not allowed:\n\nLeaving a representation of your assignment (the text, a screenshot) where students (current and future) can access it. Examples of this include websites like course hero, on a group text chain, over discord/slack, or in a file passed on to future students.\nAccessing and submitting solutions to assignments from other students distributed as above. This includes copying written answers from other students and slightly modifying the language to differentiate it.\nGoogling for complete problem solutions.\nWorking on the reading questions or individual quizzes in collaboration with other people or resources. These assignments must reflect individual work.\nSubmitting work on an quiz or final that reflects consultation with outside resources or other people. These assessments must reflect individual work.\n\nIf you have questions about the boundaries of the policy, please ask. We’re always happy to clarify.\n\nViolations of the collaboration policy\nThe integrity of our course depends on our ability to ensure that students do not violate the collaboration policy. We take this responsibility seriously and forward cases of academic misconduct to the Center for Student Conduct.\nStudents determined to have violated the academic misconduct policy by the Center for Student Conduct will receive a grade penalty in the course and a sanction from the university which is generally: (i) First violation: Non-Reportable Warning and educational intervention, (ii) Second violation: Suspension/Disciplinary Probation and educational interventions, (iii) Third violation: Dismissal.\nAnd again, if you have questions about the boundaries of the collaboration policy, please ask!\n\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat should I do if I’m on the waitlist?\nAttend both lecture and section (remember, we are teaching it as one two hour class), and submit all assignments on time. Visit your instructor on the first day of class so you can be added to the course Ed and Gradescope.\nAre class sessions recorded?\nNo. Class sessions feature a mix of group problem solving, activities, and discussion and don’t lend themselves to recording. The course notes are the main reference source for the course. Any materials used during the class session will be posted to the course website.\nIs attendance required?\nNo, but it is difficult to succeed in this course if you are not regularly attending class. Class sessions are designed to be an effective and efficient format to make progress on important assignments. Plus, it’s a great way to meet your fellow students and learn from one another. This class is very unique in that regard.\nIf you can’t attend due to a religious observance, athletic competition, or something similarly important, don’t worry. Just reach out to us via a private Ed post, and we can let you know what to keep tabs on during the time you’re away.\nAre time conflicts allowed?\n\nStat 20 does not allow students to enroll with time conflicts.\n\nWhat if I join the class late?\nIf you join the class within the first two weeks, read the syllabus and lecture notes, take a look at Gradescope to get a sense of any assignments that may have already passed, and visit office hours to check that you’re up to date with things. The first two weeks of material are very important so you must be able to make up assignments.\nAfter two weeks into the semester, you’ll have too much material that you’ll need to make up, so you will have to wait to a subsequent semester to take Stat 20.\n\n\n\nCampus Resources\nIf you ever need someone to talk to about anything that you’re going through, please feel to reach out to the instructors. For some topics, the tutors might be an even better resource because they are students just like you. Tutors can also tell you what being an Academic Student Employee (ASE) is like.\nWith regards to reports of sexual misconduct/violence/assault, you may speak with us as well, but know that we will need to report our discussion to the Title IX officer. This is detailed below.\n\nAs UC employees, the instructors (and tutors) are “Responsible Employees” and are therefore required to report incidents of sexual violence, sexual harassment, or other conduct prohibited by University policy to the Title IX officer. We cannot keep reports of sexual harassment or sexual violence confidential, but the Title IX officer will consider requests for confidentiality. Note that there are confidential resources available to you through UCB’s PATH to Care Center, which serves survivors of sexual violence and sexual harassment; call their 24/7 Care Line at 510-643-2005.\n\nBelow are some campus resources that may be helpful for you:\n\nBerkeley Supportal- great place to start\nDisabled Students’ Program\nUniversity Health Services\nUCB Path to Care\nStudent Learning Center\nBerkeley International Office\nOmbuds Office for Students and Postdoctoral Appointees\nGender Equity Resource Center\nCenter for Educational Justice & Community Engagement\nUHS Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)\nCampus Academic Accommodations Hub\nASUC Student Advocate’s Office\nBasic Needs Center\nASUC Mental Health Resources Guide"
