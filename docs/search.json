    "text": "Course Culture\nThis course brings together students from diverse backgrounds to examine housing inequality through data analysis in R. We create a collaborative, listening-centered environment where all voices are valued and where we approach housing data with critical consciousness about systemic racism and gentrification’s human impacts.\nOur shared commitments:\n\nListen first - We begin with the experiences of communities affected by housing displacement before analyzing statistics\nIntersectional analysis - We examine how race, gender, and class intersect to create different experiences of housing precarity\nRespectful dialogue - We engage difficult conversations about inequality with professionalism and care for one another\nCollective learning - We develop data skills together, supporting each other’s technical and critical learning\n\nCreating brave space: We recognize that housing data reveals uncomfortable truths about displacement and discrimination. We commit to supporting classmates who may be personally affected by housing insecurity while holding ourselves accountable for learning that serves rather than extracts from communities.\nIf you have concerns about classroom environment or need support, please reach out to me to discuss how we can better foster inclusive learning for everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials\nThe primary materials for the course are available on this website. I’ll teach you everything you need to know!\n\nRStudio\nThe software that we’ll be using for our data analysis is the free and open-source language called R that we’ll be interacting with via software called RStudio. As a Berkeley student, you have your own version of RStudio waiting you on a special data hub. This data hub syncs the class materials, giving you access to most of what you need. Most students taking this course have no experience programming; I’ll teach you everything you need to know!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow are some campus resources that may be helpful for you:\n\nBerkeley Supportal- great place to start\nDisabled Students’ Program\nUniversity Health Services\nUCB Path to Care\nStudent Learning Center\nBerkeley International Office\nOmbuds Office for Students and Postdoctoral Appointees\nGender Equity Resource Center\nCenter for Educational Justice & Community Engagement\nUHS Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)\nCampus Academic Accommodations Hub\nASUC Student Advocate’s Office\nBasic Needs Center\nASUC Mental Health Resources Guide"
