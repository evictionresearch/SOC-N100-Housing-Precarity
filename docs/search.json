    "text": "Course Culture\nThis course brings together students from diverse backgrounds to examine housing inequality through data analysis in R. We create a collaborative, listening-centered environment where all voices are valued and where we approach housing data with critical consciousness about systemic racism and gentrification’s human impacts.\nOur shared commitments:\n\nListen first - We begin with the experiences of communities affected by housing displacement before analyzing statistics\nIntersectional analysis - We examine how race, gender, and class intersect to create different experiences of housing precarity\nRespectful dialogue - We engage difficult conversations about inequality with professionalism and care for one another\nCollective learning - We develop data skills together, supporting each other’s technical and critical learning\n\nCreating brave space: We recognize that housing data reveals uncomfortable truths about displacement and discrimination. We commit to supporting classmates who may be personally affected by housing insecurity while holding ourselves accountable for learning that serves rather than extracts from communities.\nIf you have concerns about classroom environment or need support, please reach out to me to discuss how we can better foster inclusive learning for everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials\nThe primary materials for the course are available on this website. I’ll teach you everything you need to know!\n\nRStudio\nThe software that we’ll be using for our data analysis is the free and open-source language called R that we’ll be interacting with via software called RStudio. As a Berkeley student, you have your own version of RStudio waiting you on a special data hub. This data hub syncs the class materials, giving you access to most of what you need. Most students taking this course have no experience programming; I’ll teach you everything you need to know!\n\n\n\nWorkload\n\n4 hours of class time (2 hours of lecture, 2 hours of lab)\nexpect 12 hours of work outside of class after week 1\n\n\n\nInstruction Mode\nThis course will be held on Zoom with recordings posted after each class.\n\n\nCourse Requirements and Assignments\nYour grade has three components, which have the following weights:\n\nClass participation 20%\nAssignments (#1 = 20%, #2 = 20%) 40%\nFinal group project 40%\n\n\nClass participation (20%)\nParticipation in class is an important part of your learning experience and a vital skill in the working world. Participation in class also gives me richer information about your grasp of the class material and helps me make adjustments where necessary. Attendance makes up 10% for class participation and the remaining 10% is based on your participation - in-class quizzes, contributing to class discussions, asking questions, offering up potential solutions to problems, presenting a solution to an assignment, volunteering to present, and overall engagement and enrichment of the class.\nA good contribution to class discussion is a comment that possesses one or more of the following properties. (1) It offers a different and unique, but relevant, insight to the issue; moves the discussion and analysis forward to generate new insights. (2) It builds on the preceding discussion; relates to a personal anecdote or experience in a way that helps to illuminate the ideas being discussed. (3) It uses logic, evidence, and creative thinking (argument), so that it is more than merely an expression of an opinion or feeling (assertion).\n\n\nAssignments (40%).\nFor each assignment you will submit:\n\nR code script that is replicable by the grader,\na brief write up explaining your assignment with plots and context, and\n\nInclude one or more introductory paragraphs summarizing what you are analyzing and your overall findings.\nText and plots walking the reader through a more detailed understanding of what you found. Make sure to describe your plots.\nSummary conclusion and analytic insights (i.e., what the data is telling you).\n\nURL links to any and all AI usage.\n\nIn you code, put the URL in comments next to the relevant area.\nIn your write up, put the URL in footnotes near the section or text in which you used AI.\nSee AI policy below for more info.\n\n\nThese assignments will be graded on using the scale below. Anything above a D will pass. No late assignments will be accepted. You can volunteer to present a 5-minute demo of your assignment in class.\n\n\nFinal group project (40%).\nFor your final group project you and 2-3 of your peers will choose a city or county and come up with a research question you can answer with one of the datasets from the class that tests at least two hypotheses about the disparate impact or unique problem of displacement in that area. You will need to do some research about your chosen area and may even need to do some exploratory analysis of the area to see what might be a suitable research question and driver of displacement. For example, in Marin County, CA high rents are displacing the county’s workforce-age adults and young families, resulting in school closures and deterring needed residents to keep the county sustainable. Another example is Salt Lake City’s most affordable neighborhoods are also experiencing high rates of displacement, meaning there is no where for displaced residents to move to that is affordable. Find something that would be compelling for the city or county to know about the problem of displacement in their area.\n\nYou will submit a final report, R code, and a short slide presentation (no longer than 10 slides) showcasing your question, your methods and key results.\nOn the last day you will present your project to the class.\n\n\n\n\nCourse Grading\nA+ 97+ | A 93-96 | A- 90-92\nB+ 87-89 | B 83-86 | B- 80-82\nC+ 77-79 | C 73-76 | C- 70-72\nD+ 67-69 | D 63-66 | D- 60-62\nF 0-59\n\n\nLate work policy\nNo late work will be accepted.\n\n\nAI Policy\nAI is allowed and encouraged in this course as it is crucial to learn how to use these tools effectively for your future work. However, it is vital to recognize both the strengths and limitations of AI to avoid jeopardizing your projects and future career. Here are some key considerations:\nUnderstanding AI’s Role\n\nInformation Synthesis: AI excels at synthesizing information but does not create new knowledge. It serves as a broad assistant for research, writing improvement, and coding tasks.\nLimitations of Training Data: AI models are constrained by their training data and cannot generate truly novel ideas or content beyond this scope.\nPotential for Errors: AI hallucinations and misinterpretations are real concerns. Always critically evaluate and verify AI-generated content.\n\nEffective AI Usage\n\nPrompt Engineering: The quality of AI output heavily depends on the quality of input. Craft clear, specific prompts to get the best results.\nHuman Expertise: You are the domain expert. Ensure that AI is working for you and aligning with your goals and expectations.\nFact-Checking: Always verify AI-generated information, especially for recent events or specialized topics.\n\nEthical Considerations\n\nAttribution: When using AI-generated content, properly attribute it in your work.\nAcademic Integrity: Use AI as a tool for learning and productivity, not as a substitute for your own critical thinking and analysis.\nBias Awareness: Be mindful of potential biases in AI-generated content and strive for diverse perspectives.\n\nBe vigilant about model changes moving forward: As AI advances, be aware of both improvements to models as well as possible problems (i.e., increasing censorship, how it was trained, developer intent, etc.).\nIn this class you will use perplexity.ai because it allows you to test and use multiple language models (e.g., OpenAI, Claude, Lamma, and a few more) and searches the web to find the most recent information about a topic. Access to the web supplements its knowledge and usefulness. Sign up for a discounted perplexity pro account at https://plex.it/referrals/OXHAU39O\nDo not use any other AI platform without permission. You will be required to provide URLs to your use of Perplexity so we can understand your use of it and help develop your skills.\nResponsible AI Use\n\nTransparency: Be open about your use of AI tools in your work.\nIterative Approach: Use AI as part of an iterative process. Start with creating some content and then ask AI to refine and improve results with your own expertise.\nSkill Development: Focus on developing skills in prompt engineering, critical evaluation, and effective integration of AI-generated content.\n\nReporting Issues\nIf you encounter any problems or have concerns about AI use in the course, please report them to the instructor promptly.\nBy following these guidelines, you’ll be better equipped to harness the power of AI while maintaining the integrity and quality of your academic work in computational social science.\n\n\nCode of Conduct\nStudents and the instructor will abide by the UC Berkeley Code of Conduct.\n\n\nPrimary Datasets & Tools\nThe American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau that provides vital information about the United States and its people. Released annually, the ACS covers a broad range of topics including social, economic, housing, and demographic characteristics of the U.S. population. Some of the primary variables used to measure displacement that are derived from the ACS include housing characteristics, rent, racial and ethnic compositions, incomes, and migration.\ntidycensus is an R package that provides a user-friendly interface to access ACS data directly within the R environment. It allows users to retrieve ACS data in a tidy format, ready for analysis with tidyverse tools. With tidycensus, you can easily download ACS data for various geographic levels (e.g., states, counties, census tracts) and years, and include spatial data for mapping purposes.\n\n\nDisabled Student Program (DSP)\nUC Berkeley is committed to creating a learning environment that meets the needs of its diverse student body including students with disabilities. If you anticipate or experience any barriers to learning in this course, please feel welcome to discuss your concerns with me.\nIf you have a disability, or think you may have a disability, you can work with the Disabled Students’ Program (DSP) to request an official accommodation. The Disabled Students’ Program (DSP) is the campus office responsible for authorizing disability-related academic accommodations, in cooperation with the students themselves and their instructors. You can find more information about DSP, including contact information and the application process here: dsp.berkeley.edu. If you have already been approved for accommodations through DSP, please meet with me so we can develop an implementation plan together.”\nStudents who need academic accommodations or have questions about their accommodations should contact DSP, located at 260 César Chávez Student Center. Students may call 642-0518 (voice), 642-6376 (TTY), or e-mail dsp@berkeley.edu(link sends e-mail).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow are some campus resources that may be helpful for you:\n\nBerkeley Supportal- great place to start\nDisabled Students’ Program\nUniversity Health Services\nUCB Path to Care\nStudent Learning Center\nBerkeley International Office\nOmbuds Office for Students and Postdoctoral Appointees\nGender Equity Resource Center\nCenter for Educational Justice & Community Engagement\nUHS Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)\nCampus Academic Accommodations Hub\nASUC Student Advocate’s Office\nBasic Needs Center\nASUC Mental Health Resources Guide"
