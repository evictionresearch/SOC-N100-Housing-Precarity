    <div class="block-title"></div>
    This course introduces students to the intersecting crises of eviction, displacement, and gentrification through data-driven analysis. Using the U.S. Census and R programming, you’ll learn to quantify racial inequality, track segregation patterns, and map gentrification’s impact on vulnerable communities. Through weekly lectures, coding labs, and interactive online modules, we’ll explore how housing precarity disproportionately affects marginalized groups while building practical skills in R and data visualization. By term’s end, you’ll create dynamic maps and interactive dashboards that reveal hidden stories behind eviction trends, rent burden disparities, and neighborhood change – equipping you to communicate complex social issues through both sociological theory and cutting-edge data tools. Designed for beginners in coding, this fully online course emphasizes real-world applications, with case studies ranging from urban displacement in coastal cities to rural housing instability.

<section id="course-culture" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="course-culture">Course Culture</h3>
<p>Students taking Stat 20 come from a wide range of backgrounds. We hope to foster an inclusive and supportive learning environment based on curiosity rather than competition. All members of the course community—the instructor, students, tutors, and readers—are expected to treat each other with courtesy and respect.</p>
<p>You will be interacting with course staff and fellow students in several different environments: in class, over the discussion forum, and in office hours. Some of these will be in person, some of them will be online, but the same expectations hold: be kind, be respectful, be professional.</p>
<p>If you are concerned about classroom environment issues created by other students or course staff, please come talk to us about it.</p>
</section>
<section id="mode-of-instruction" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mode-of-instruction">Mode of Instruction</h3>
<p>This course is structured as a flipped class, meaning that you will first be encountering new concepts in statistics and data science <em>outside</em> of class. Class time is dedicated to expanding on the work you’ve done outside of class by working through questions solo, in groups, and as a class.</p>
<!--
The reason that this course is structured in this manner is that applied data science is a complex field that unites scientific thinking, computing, mathematics, and an understanding of the context of the data. We will be able to tackle more interesting and challenging questions if we make room during class time to work on them while we're all in the same place.
-->
<section id="before-class" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="before-class">Before class</h4>
<p><strong>It is your responsibility to become familiar with the topics that appear in the course notes and to work through the reading questions on Gradescope by 11:59 pm Monday (for Tues/Weds class) and 11:59 pm Wednesday (for Thurs/Fri class)</strong>. You’re encouraged to experiment to find the method that works best for you: downloading the notes as a pdf and making notes on them, asking and answering questions over the class forum, etc.</p>

<section id="during-class-on-tuewed-and-thufri" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="during-class-on-tuewed-and-thufri">During class on Tue/Wed and Thu/Fri</h4>
<p>Class time (2 hrs) will be spent on a range of activities, but the most common will be concept questions (using Poll Everywhere) and working through components of your Problem Sets and Labs. Therefore, the most efficient way to complete your assignments is to be an active participant in class. Attendance is expected on these class days.</p>
</section>
<section id="during-class-on-monday" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="during-class-on-monday">During class on Monday</h4>
<p>Monday is shorter (1 hr) class that alternates between:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workshops: less-structured class dedicated to finishing up work on your assignments</li>
<li>Quizzes: see information on quizzes below.</li>
</ul>
<!--
#### Plenary lectures

Several times during the semester, the course will be hosting a special guest to give a lecture to all sections of Stat 20. These speakers are preeminent scientists and data scientists from academia or industry who will speak about how the ideas and tools from Stat 20 are used in and impact the real world. These plenary lectures will be held outside of class time in the evening and the schedule will be announced during the semester. 

As a part of the graded assignments for the class **you will be asked to attend three lectures outside the class and hand in a small written assignment about each**. These lecture could be the Stat 20 plenary lectures or they could be from another event; the only restriction is that they have to be related to data science.
-->
</section>
<section id="group-tutoring" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="group-tutoring">Group tutoring</h4>
<p>Tutors will offer group tutoring sessions several times each week. This is an opportunity to finish up any assignments that you’ve started in class or review any topics that are confusing for you. Each group tutoring session will be staffed by 2-4 tutors. You’re welcome to attend any session that works well for your schedule.</p>
<p>Group tutoring is a great place to go to meet other students and collaborate on assignments with tutors on hand to help you get unstuck.</p>
</section>
<section id="instructor-office-hours" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="instructor-office-hours">Instructor Office Hours</h4>
<p>The instructors will offer office hours each week across a range of times. We ask that you only visit the office hours of your instructor, but you are welcome to visit the tutoring sessions of <em>any</em> tutors, not just the ones who work in your section. We may adjust the office hour and group tutoring sessions schedule throughout the semester as we understand student needs and preferences. Please check the office hours tab on the syllabus page to see the times of the various office hour/group tutoring sessions.</p>
<p>Office hours are an opportunity to chat one-on-one with your instructor. Please come to office hours! Coming to office hours does not send a signal that you are behind or need extra help. On the contrary, coming to office hours early and often tends to co-occur with success in the course. Instructors are happy to chat about the course material, statistics in general, careers in statistics, and whatever other statistics or data science topics are on your mind!</p>

<section id="dont-come-to-class-if-youre-sick" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dont-come-to-class-if-youre-sick">Don’t come to class if you’re sick!</h4>
<p>Maintaining your health and that of the Berkeley community is of primary importance to course staff, so if you are feeling ill or have been exposed to illness, whether it’s COVID-19 or something else, please do not come to class. All of the materials used in class will be posted to the course website. You’re encouraged to reach out to fellow students to discuss the class materials or stop by group tutoring or office hours to chat with a tutor or the instructor.</p>

<p>We will use bCourses to disseminate announcements for the entire class, such as final exam information.</p>
</section>
<section id="discussion-forum" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="discussion-forum">Discussion forum</h4>
<p>The official discussion forum for the class will be hosted on <a href="https://www.edstem.org">Ed</a>. Ed is a forum to ask and answer questions with your fellow students and course staff. It’s an indispensable resource for learning from your peers and seeking help from tutors and instructors.</p>
<p>If you have a question for staff, create a new post and mark it as “private” and it will go only to course staff. This is the best option to contact us if you have a personal concern. If your question does not include personal information and can be answered by other students, make sure it is public.</p>
<p>In a course this large, the instructors have a difficult time responding to individual emails, so please use the class forum or visit office hours if you wish to contact us!</p>
</section>
<section id="course-website" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="course-website">Course website</h4>
<p>All of the assignments will be posted to the course website at <a href="https://stat20.org">https://stat20.org</a>. This also holds the course notes, the syllabus, and links to Gradescope, Ed, and RStudio.</p>

<section id="turning-in-assignments" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="turning-in-assignments">Turning-in assignments</h4>
<p>You will be turning in your assignments on a platform called <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/">Gradescope</a>. This is also the platform where your assignments will be graded, so you can return there to get feedback on your work. You are welcome to file a regrade request if you notice that we made an error in applying the rubric to your work.</p>
</section>
<section id="labs" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="labs">Labs</h4>
<p>Labs are long-form assignments designed to apply the concepts from the lecture notes in the cause of doing an analysis of real data. This will involve both writing code and communicating your thoughts and findings in English. We’ll be working through some problems from the labs in class, but you may have to complete them on your own outside of class time. Some labs will be turned in individually; some will be turned in as groups.</p>
<p>Labs are to be submitted as PDF files. These PDFs will be generated by rendering Quarto Documents (.qmd files) to HTML and then exporting the HTML into a PDF. Don’t worry if you’re not familiar with the Quarto Document as we will teach you about it!</p>
<p>We will be assessing most questions on labs for correctness but for others we will be giving credit based on completion.</p>
</section>
<section id="problem-sets" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="problem-sets">Problem Sets</h4>
<p>During class, we will give you a second engagement with the day’s material in the form of a worksheet. These worksheets will run like traditional homework problems and drill the concepts in the reading notes rather than asking you to apply the concepts with a data set, like the lab does.</p>
<!--
The problem sets will be procured completely from these in-class worksheets and released in one or two week intervals.
-->
</section>
<section id="reading-questions" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reading-questions">Reading Questions</h4>
<p>Reading questions serve to check your understanding and engagement while going through the lecture notes prior to class. There will be a handful of questions per lecture note. These questions be a mix of multiple choice, short answer, and coding questions. You can answer them directly on Gradescope. The reading questions will be <strong>due 11:59 pm on Mondays (for the Tuesday/Wednesday lectures) and Wednesdays (for the Thursday/Friday lectures)</strong>.</p>
<!--
#### Plenary Lecture Reviews

An important way to engage with new ideas and people at a University is to attend guest lectures. Stat 20 will host 3-5 such lectures over the course of semester and will also provide a list of guest lectures in other departments that focus on topics related to probability, statistics, and data science.

A plenary lecture review is a written assignment that details the background of the speaker, the question they address, the tools, data, and methods they use, and their key findings. You will be asked to submit three such lecture reviews over the course of the semester based on the lectures that you have chosen to attend. These lecture reviews will be due at the end of the semester.
-->
</section>
<section id="quizzes" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="quizzes">Quizzes</h4>
<p>Quizzes reinforce the most important concepts from the lecture notes and provide you the opportunity to work through misunderstandings of concepts with peers and the instructor.</p>
<p>There is both an <em>individual</em> and <em>group</em> component to the quiz.</p>
<p>The <em>individual</em> component will last ~25 minutes. You are allowed one, A4, one-sided handwritten sheet of notes. The <em>group</em> component will take place immediately after the individual component has been completed and will last ~15 minutes. Your final (composite) quiz grade will be the average of your group and individual quiz scores.</p>
</section>
<section id="exam" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="exam">Exam</h4>
<p>The final exam will be held in person during finals week. The time and date is <strong>Thursday, May 9 from 7-10pm</strong> (apologies).</p>
</section>
<section id="grading" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="grading">Grading</h4>
<p>Your final grade in the course will be computed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Labs 35%</li>
<li>Reading Questions: 3%</li>
<li>Quizzes 25%</li>
<li>Problem sets 7%</li>
<li>Final 30%</li>
</ul>
<p>The grades will not be curved (&gt; 90% is some kind of A, etc.).</p>
<p>In order to provide flexibility around emergencies that might arise for you throughout the semester (for example, missing a quiz due to COVID), we will apply for everyone:</p>
<ul>
<li>one emergency drop for quizzes<br>
</li>
<li>one emergency drop for labs</li>
<li>two emergency drops for problem sets</li>
<li>two emergency drops for reading questions.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means, for example, that we will drop your lowest quiz score before computing your average score across all quizzes.</p>

<p>Stat 20 is a course that is designed to allow all students to succeed. If you have letters of accommodations from the Disabled Students’ Program, please share them with your instructor as soon as possible, and we will work out the necessary arrangements.</p>
</section>
<section id="late-work" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="late-work">Late Work</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, with a class of this size, we are unable to keep track of and grade submissions of labs, reading questions, and problem sets that come in very late. If you narrowly miss the standard deadline, you will still be able to submit within an hour for a small penalty (5% reduction in score). If you don’t submit within an hour you can still submit for a larger penalty (30% reduction).</p>

<p>You are encouraged to collaborate with your fellow students on problem sets and labs, but the work you turn in should reflect your own understanding and all of your collaborators must be cited. The individual component of quizzes, reading questions, and exams must reflect only your work.</p>
<p>Researchers don’t use one another’s research without permission; scholars and students always use proper citations in papers; professors may not circulate or publish student papers without the writer’s permission; and students may not circulate or post non-public materials (quizzes, exams, rubrics-any private class materials) from their class without the written permission of the instructor.</p>
<p>The general rule: you must not submit assignments that reflect the work of others unless they are a cited collaborator.</p>
<p>The following examples of collaboration <strong>are</strong> allowed and in fact encouraged!</p>
<ul>
<li>Discussing how to solve a problem with a classmate.</li>
<li>Showing your code to a classmate along with an error message or confusing output.</li>
<li>Posting snippets of your code to the discussion forum when seeking help.</li>
<li>Helping other students solve questions on the discussion with conceptual pointers or snippets of code that doesn’t whole hog give away the answer.</li>
<li>Googling the text of an error message.</li>
<li>Copying small snippets of code from answers on Stack Overflow.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following examples are <strong>not</strong> allowed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leaving a representation of your assignment (the text, a screenshot) where students (current and future) can access it. Examples of this include websites like course hero, on a group text chain, over discord/slack, or in a file passed on to future students.</li>
<li>Accessing and submitting solutions to assignments from other students distributed as above. This includes copying written answers from other students and slightly modifying the language to differentiate it.</li>
<li>Googling for complete problem solutions.</li>
<li>Working on the reading questions or individual quizzes in collaboration with other people or resources. These assignments must reflect individual work.</li>
<li>Submitting work on an quiz or final that reflects consultation with outside resources or other people. These assessments must reflect individual work.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have questions about the boundaries of the policy, please ask. We’re always happy to clarify.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="violations-of-the-collaboration-policy">Violations of the collaboration policy</h4>
<p>The integrity of our course depends on our ability to ensure that students do not violate the collaboration policy. We take this responsibility seriously and forward cases of academic misconduct to the Center for Student Conduct.</p>
<p>Students determined to have violated the academic misconduct policy by the Center for Student Conduct will receive a grade penalty in the course and a sanction from the university which is generally: (i) First violation: Non-Reportable Warning and educational intervention, (ii) Second violation: Suspension/Disciplinary Probation and educational interventions, (iii) Third violation: Dismissal.</p>
<p>And again, if you have questions about the boundaries of the collaboration policy, please ask!</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>What should I do if I’m on the waitlist?</p>
<p>Attend <em>both</em> lecture and section (remember, we are teaching it as <em>one</em> two hour class), and submit all assignments on time. Visit your instructor on the first day of class so you can be added to the course Ed and Gradescope.</p></li>
<li><p>Are class sessions recorded?</p>
<p>No.&nbsp;Class sessions feature a mix of group problem solving, activities, and discussion and don’t lend themselves to recording. The course notes are the main reference source for the course. Any materials used during the class session will be posted to the course website.</p></li>
<li><p>Is attendance required?</p>
<p>No, but it is difficult to succeed in this course if you are not regularly attending class. Class sessions are designed to be an effective and efficient format to make progress on important assignments. Plus, it’s a great way to meet your fellow students and learn from one another. This class is very unique in that regard.</p>
<p>If you can’t attend due to a religious observance, athletic competition, or something similarly important, don’t worry. Just reach out to us via a private Ed post, and we can let you know what to keep tabs on during the time you’re away.</p></li>
<li><p>Are time conflicts allowed?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Stat 20 does not allow students to enroll with time conflicts.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p>What if I join the class late?</p>
<p>If you join the class within the first two weeks, read the syllabus and lecture notes, take a look at Gradescope to get a sense of any assignments that may have already passed, and visit office hours to check that you’re up to date with things. The first two weeks of material are very important so you must be able to make up assignments.</p>
<p>After two weeks into the semester, you’ll have too much material that you’ll need to make up, so you will have to wait to a subsequent semester to take Stat 20.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you ever need someone to talk to about anything that you’re going through, please feel to reach out to the instructors. For some topics, the tutors might be an even better resource because they are students just like you. Tutors can also tell you what being an Academic Student Employee (ASE) is like.</p>
<p>With regards to reports of sexual misconduct/violence/assault, you may speak with us as well, but know that we will need to report our discussion to the Title IX officer. This is detailed below.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>As UC employees, the instructors (and tutors) are “Responsible Employees” and are therefore required to report incidents of sexual violence, sexual harassment, or other conduct prohibited by University policy to the Title IX officer. We cannot keep reports of sexual harassment or sexual violence confidential, but the Title IX officer will consider requests for confidentiality. Note that there are confidential resources available to you through UCB’s PATH to Care Center, which serves survivors of sexual violence and sexual harassment; call their 24/7 Care Line at 510-643-2005.</em></p>
