# Week 2 R In Class Exercise: How do we measure soft displacement drivers?
# In this week's exercise, we will be working with the American Community Survey
# (ACS) data to measure soft displacement drivers. We will be focusing on rent
# and housing cost burden as key indicators of displacement risk. Finally, we
# will be using the R programming language to analyze the data and generate
# insights.
# =============================================================================

#
# Install packages and options
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Before we start, we need to install and load the necessary packages for this
# exercise.
install.packages("tidyverse")  # Install the tidyverse package
install.packages("tidycensus")  # Install the tidyverse package

library(tidyverse)  # Load the tidyverse package
library(tidycensus)  # Load the tidycensus package
census_api_key("63217a192c5803bfc72aab537fe4bf19f6058326", overwrite = TRUE, install = TRUE)
# you should replace this API key with your own. You can get one from the US
# Census Bureau at https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html

# The first thing we want to do is load some variables in R that we will use to
# look at some neighborhood conditions related to displacement.

#
# Load household income and race data
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# First, let's find the variable for median household income in the
# American Community Survey (ACS) data.
vars_2022 <- load_variables(2022, "acs5")
View(vars_2022)
# In the table, look for the key word "Median Household" and notice how
# there are different tables and combinations of tables.

# Get county-level area median household income (AMI) data from ACS
sf_median_income <- get_acs(
    geography = "county",
    variables = "B19013_001",  # Median household income
    year = 2022,
    state = "CA",
    county = "San Francisco"
)

# Lets look at the different columns in the data.
sf_median_income

# GEOID is the unique identifier for the county.
# NAME is the name of the county.
# B19013_001 is the median household income.
# estimate is the value of the median household income.
# moe is the margin of error for the estimate.

# One way to look at low-income households is to break median income
# into meaningful brackets.
# - Low-income (<80% AMI)
# - Middle-income (80-120% AMI)
# - High-income (>120% AMI)

# We can do this by using the "mutate" function in tidyverse.
sf_ami <- sf_median_income %>%
    mutate(
        # Calculate low income threshold as 80% of median income estimate
        low_income = estimate * .8,
        # Calculate high income threshold as 120% of median income estimate
        high_income = estimate * 1.2
    )

# Why do we use this AMI bracket? Well, the federal government defines "poverty"
# for a single person as $12,880. This is 100% of the federal poverty level.
# $12,880 is considered incredibly "low-income" by all means, however, the cost
# of living in a particular area varies widely. For example, $13k in Mississippi
# might go further than it would in San Francisco. To understand the local
# conditions, we use the federal governments definition of "low income" as 80%
# of the median income. Using the local AMI as a reference point, we can then
# define "low income" relative to the conditions in which a household lives.
# So, we can see that "Low-income" is $109,351. Let's see what it is in
# Jackson, Mississippi.

# Note: Plots are effective ways to tell a story. However, keep your
# story simple. Avoid using more than 2 or 3 items in a plot. If you
# have more than 3 items, consider breaking them into multiple plots.
# For example, the plot above is telling us race, income, and degrees
# of difference. Anything more and you will start to lose your audience
# in confusion. A plot should be well documented and just about self
# explanatory by looking at the title and axis labels.
